Exercise 1 (CQ):  Compare the code for the Ice_Cream0 and Ice_Cream classes.  What are all the differences you can find?
a difference is that the length differs. Another is that in the first iteration
the consturcter private parts contain takeout and order time while the new version dows not.
The constructer in the new iteration is shorter takes the superclass as a variable to pass in information.

Exercise 2 (CQ):  Do these classes require a copy constructor or assignment operator to prevent memory allocation errors?  Why or why not?
This class does not need a copy constructer or assignment operator because there is no need to copy anything
also the superclass values would change depending on when the object is called.
