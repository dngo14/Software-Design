Exercise 1 (CQ):  What is a situation where you might want to start with an array of one size, and later change it to an array of a different size?
You might want to use an array of one size to ask the user a question and the initial array was not long enough for the users response. 

Exercise 3 (CQ):  Explain why the program would appear to run just fine, if we left out the call to delete inside the change_items function.
The program would appear to run fine because it would use a different memory allocation to hold the 3 values and leave the 2 values initially still inside the memory.

Exercise 4 (CQ): Explain why it is appropriate, even correct, to call delete inside the change_items function.
It is correct to call the delete function in the change_items, because when we call that function it is when we want to replace the initial 2 memory slots and increase it.
